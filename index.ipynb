    "## Introduction \n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab you'll perform an exploratory data analysis task, using statistical and visual EDA skills. You'll continue using the Lego dataset that you've acquired and cleaned in the previous labs. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Objectives\n",
    "You will be able to:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Check the distribution of various columns\n",
    "* Examine the descriptive statistics of our dataset\n",
    "* Create visualizations to help us better understand our dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data Exploration\n",
    "\n",
    "At this point, you've already done a modest amount of data exploration between investigating the initial dataset to further exploring individual features while cleaning things up in preparation for modeling. During this process, you've become more familiar with the particular idiosyncrasies of the dataset. This gives you an opportunity to uncover difficulties and potential pitfalls in working with the dataset as well as potential avenues for feature engineering that could improve the predictive performance of your model down the line. Remember that this is also not a linear process; after building an initial model, you might go back and continue to mine the dataset for potential inroads to create additional features and improve the model's performance if initial results did not satisfy your needs and expectations. Here, you'll continue this process, investigating the distributions of some of the various features and their relationship to the target variable: `list_price`."

While definitive checks for multicollinearity require analyzing the resulting model, predictors with overly high pairwise-correlation (r > .65) are almost certain to produce multicollinearity in a model. With that, take a minute to generate the pairwise (pearson) correlation coefficients of your predictive features and visualize these coefficients as a heatmap."
